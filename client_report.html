    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p><strong>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</strong><br>
      I just chose the best images that represent beautiful places in the Philippines. I wanted my website to reflect the natural beauty and culture of my country, so I picked visuals that were colorful, engaging, and appealing to visitors.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</strong><br>
      My original lead developer went missing and did not respond to any of my messages. I tried reaching out several times but received no reply. Thankfully, I was assigned a new lead developer who was very responsive and professional. They sent me an email introducing themselves and kept me informed throughout the process.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</strong><br>
      Yes, my developer did a great job. The final website met my expectations and somehow looked how I envisioned it.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</strong><br>
      Next time, I will clearly set expectations and deadlines from the start. I will also make sure to establish better communication methods upfront, so if problems arise, I can quickly get updates or request a replacement if needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p><strong>How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs?</strong><br>
      I managed my team by sending updates and assignments through email. Whenever I had changes or progress updates, I made sure to inform the junior developers so they could make the necessary edits.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</strong><br>
      I texted my client and sent them previews of the website to check if everything was okay. However, it was sometimes difficult to get a timely response because the client was not always in class or available to reply.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How did you handle publishing your client's site and sharing it with the client?</strong><br>
      At first, I had issues publishing the site because of spaces in some of the file names and documents. Fortunately, my professor helped me resolve those issues, and I was able to publish the site successfully and share it with the client.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</strong><br>
      Using GitHub was a bit tricky at times, especially when it came to errors or syncing changes. But whenever I ran into a problem, I asked my professor for help, and I learned more each time.
    </p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p><strong>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</strong><br>
      There were no issues at all. Whenever the team lead asked me to make changes or complete tasks, I responded right away and made sure everything was done correctly.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</strong><br>
      Yes, I was fully aware of what was expected. My team lead gave clear instructions, so I always knew what my responsibilities were.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</strong><br>
      Yes, I was able to contribute and help with various parts of the site, including layout and design edits.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</strong><br>
      No, I didn’t have any problems with GitHub. Everything worked smoothly for me.
    </p>

    <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
    <p><strong>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</strong><br>
      There wasn’t a specific part of the project that I found extremely challenging. I felt comfortable working through each step and asked for help when I needed it.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What did you enjoy most about this project?</strong><br>
      I really enjoyed designing and styling different types of websites. It was fun to see how everything came together visually and functionally.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</strong><br>
      If I could do the project again, I would add more features and interactivity to make the websites more dynamic and engaging.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</strong><br>
      Yes, I definitely feel more confident now. Before this class, I had zero knowledge of web development, but now I can create and publish websites, work with GitHub, and collaborate with a team. This experience gave me the foundation to work on real-world projects.
